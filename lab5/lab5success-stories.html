                    <p class="blockquote__text">“I’m so freaking proud of this woman right here!! @able.body feared jumping her entire life, due to her cerebral palsy ... This week, she took on 18.2 with burpees over a bar! Before we started I could tell she was a little nervous, so I told her we could lower the height of her bar. But her response was, 'Jamie, I’ve never gotten anywhere in life doing things the easy way. Let’s do this, and if I fall, I fall.' The 12 minutes of 18.2 were a beautiful thing to watch, as I saw her confidence grow and she improved with each jump ... March is Cerebral Palsy Awareness Month, and Janet’s courage and attitude are at the forefront of inspiration for all!”</p>
